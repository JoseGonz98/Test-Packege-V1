# Watchit UIX - UI/UX Component Library
>Watchit UIX is a UI/UX component library designed for reuse across multiple platforms, such as mobile, desktop, web, TV, and more. The library is built on three layers of abstraction which allow for modular and flexible interface building.

## Layers of abstraction:
**Atoms:** Atom components are the most basic building blocks that make up the interface. These components should not depend on other elements and should be designed to be as independent as possible. Some examples of atoms include Input, Label, RoundProgress, Icon, and Logo.

**Molecules:** Molecule components are those that are mainly composed of atom components. These components are more complex and can include several atoms. Some examples of molecules include ChannelItem and Poster.

**Organisms:** Organism components are those that are mainly composed of molecule and atom components. These components are even more complex and can include several molecules and atoms. Some examples of organisms include MobileMenu and MobileHeader.

## Installation
